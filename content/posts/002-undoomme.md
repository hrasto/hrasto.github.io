*Undoomme* will be a tool designed to help people to break the habit of doomscrolling.

On [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomscrolling), it says: 

*Doomscrolling or doomsurfing is the act of spending an excessive amount of time reading large quantities of news online. Doomscrolling can also be defined as the excessive consumption of vertical, short-form videos for a long period of time, without knowing the amount of time passed.*

The definition I plan to adopt is more along the lines of prolonged interaction with recommender systems from famous social media servers.

The features the user should be provided with are threefold: 

* logging
* notifications
* blockade

For now, this will be the landing page of [undoomme.com](https://undoomme.com), but later I will probably make a more proper website.
