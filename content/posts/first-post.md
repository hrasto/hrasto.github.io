After magically [^1] missing last week's NAACL submission deadline, I decided it is about time to think about my past (and future) research.
Somehow I feel (and mainly hope), that the long-lasting (relative to the length of my PhD contract) stroke of cynicism, a part of my [quarter-life crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter-life_crisis), is beginning to temper.
So, here I am, building what I always thought could not be built due to lack of content: *my personal website*.
To my great surprise, when I listed and counted my [publications](/publications), including a poster which I contributed to in my bachelor's thesis and some papers I am not proud of, the total amount turned out to be **5**! 
I thought that is not bad actually. 

The plan is to, occasionally, post here about my publications, research-related observations, career progress, or just general thoughts. 
Let's pray it won't be too cringey and regrettable. You will not find any emojis here. See you!
