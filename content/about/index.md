I live in Tilburg, the Netherlands, and I come from [Marianka, Slovakia](https://www.google.com/maps/place/900+33+Marianka/).
I speak English, German, and Slovak fluently, and Dutch barely. 
In my free time, I gym and run. 

In 2018, I received a bachelor's degree in *Computer Science* (with specialization scientific computing) at the University of Vienna. 
In 2020, I graduated from the one-year master program in *Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence* at Tilburg University.
Right after, I began my PhD with [Emmanuel Keuleers](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/staff/e-a-keuleers).
