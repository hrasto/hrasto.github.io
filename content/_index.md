I am a PhD candidate at [JADS](https://www.jads.nl), supervised by [Emmanuel Keuleers](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/staff/e-a-keuleers).
In my research, I explore statistical structure of language, the role it plays in learning representations of text, and how exploiting it improves efficiency and modularity of language processing systems.

I collaborate with:
- [Yixia Wang](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/staff/y-wang_1) on systems enabling compositional analysis of Chinese characters,
- [Tomáš Hronský](https://www.instagram.com/tomaas_hronsky/) on a (secret) mobile game,
- [Milan Hronský](https://mhrons.github.io) consulting his renewable power smoothing [project](https://mhrons.github.io/).
