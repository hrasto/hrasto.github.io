Currently, I am busy wrapping up my PhD. 
In my research, I explore statistical properties of language structure, how they correspond to word recognition measures in humans, and how they can be used to improve efficiency, transparency, and modularity of artificial language processing systems.  
Most of my work is published with the help of my supervisor, [Emmanuel Keuleers](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/staff/e-a-keuleers). 
Along with [Yixia Wang](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/staff/y-wang_1), I also work on systems that analyze the structure of Chinese characters.
Together with [Tomáš Hronský](https://www.instagram.com/matfyz_je_introvertny/), we work on a secret mobile game. 
Lastly, I helped my [Milan Hronský](https://mhrons.github.io) build and install some of his solar irradiance measuring [equipment](https://mhrons.github.io/pv_log/). 
In my free time, I gym and run.
