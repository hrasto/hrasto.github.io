I am a PhD candidate at [JADS](https://www.jads.nl), supervised by [Emmanuel Keuleers](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/staff/e-a-keuleers).
In my research, I explore statistical structure of language, the role it plays in learning representations of text, and how exploiting it improves efficiency and modularity of language processing systems.

Along with [Yixia Wang](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/staff/y-wang_1), I also work on systems enabling compositional analysis of Chinese characters.
Together with [Tomáš Hronský](https://www.instagram.com/tomaas_hronsky/), we work on a secret mobile game. 
I also helped my [Milan Hronský](https://mhrons.github.io) build and install some of his solar irradiance measuring [equipment](https://mhrons.github.io/pv_log/).
