Currently, I am busy delivering the last chapters of my PhD thesis. 
In my research, I explore statistical properties of language structure, how they correspond to measures of word recognition in humans, and how they can be used to improve efficiency, transparency, and modularity of artificial language processing systems.  
Most of my work is published with the help of my supervisor, [Emmanuel Keuleers](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/staff/e-a-keuleers). 
With [Yixia Wang](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/staff/y-wang_1), I collaborate on systems that analyze the structure of Chinese characters.
Together with [Tomáš Hronský](https://www.instagram.com/matfyz_je_introvertny/), we work on a secret mobile game. 
I also helped [Milan Hronský](https://mhrons.github.io) build and install some of his solar irradiance measurement [equipment](https://mhrons.github.io/pv_log/). 
In my free time, I gym and run.
