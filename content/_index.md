I am a PhD candidate at [JADS](https://www.jads.nl), supervised by [Emmanuel Keuleers](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/staff/e-a-keuleers).
In my research, I explore statistical segmentation of language, the role it plays in learning representations of text, and how exploiting it improves efficiency and modularity of language processing systems.
